Your first step is to insert any image you'd like, and make it fully expands the screen. Use the arrows or crop tool to make sure your image fits the entire slide.

<br />
Make sure your rectangle shape covers the entire slide. Color it any color you'd like, I chose black.

<br />
<br />
Insert a text box and type any text you'd like. Enlarge your text so it fills the screen and change the color of the text to white so that you can see it.

This is the most important step and it has to be done in this order for it to work. Hold down the SHIFT button on your keyboard, click the black rectangle first, click the text second, and finally find the "merge shapes" icon and click "Combine".
